# Zomato-Restaurant-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a Zomato dataset using both Tableau and Power BI to uncover key insights about restaurant trends, customer preferences, and service availability across various cities and countries.

ðŸ”· Tableau:
In Tableau, I designed a clean and interactive dashboard that allows users to:

Explore top cities and countries by restaurant count

Analyze cuisine popularity and average cost comparisons

Visualize customer ratings and votes

Understand the availability of online delivery and table booking

Key Features Used:

Interactive filters, slicers, and parameters

Geo maps for location-based insights

Calculated fields for customized metrics

Pie charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, and KPI cards

ðŸŸ¨ Power BI:
Using Power BI, I built a similar dashboard with added focus on data modeling and DAX for in-depth insights. The dashboard includes:

Dynamic visuals for comparing restaurant data by country and city

Custom DAX measures for analyzing rating trends, average costs, and service types

Clean page navigation and slicers for a user-friendly experience

Key Features Used:

Power Query for data transformation

DAX for calculated columns and measures

Map visuals, column charts, donut charts, and cards

Bookmark navigation for smooth storytelling

This project showcases the strengths of both toolsâ€”Tableau for visual storytelling and Power BI for robust modeling and business analytics. It highlights how both platforms can be used effectively to analyze real-world datasets and support data-driven decision-making.
