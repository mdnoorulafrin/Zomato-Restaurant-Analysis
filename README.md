# Zomato-Restaurant-Analysis
This project demonstrates how Tableau can be used to visualize and analyze restaurant data from Zomato, offering insights into dining trends across various countries and cities.

Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights:

Top cities and countries by restaurant count

Popular cuisines and average cost comparisons

Customer ratings and vote distributions

Online delivery and table booking availability

 Tableau Features Used:
 
Interactive filters and parameters for dynamic exploration

Calculated fields to derive key metrics like cost categories and delivery options

Geo maps to show restaurant presence by location

KPI cards, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots for visual storytelling

This dashboard allows users to uncover patterns and insights useful for business decision-making in the food and restaurant industry.
